# Rules

+ Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
+ Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
+ Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
+ Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
